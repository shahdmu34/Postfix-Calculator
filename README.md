# Postfix-Calculator
This project is a calculator that uses postfix notation and a Stack to perform calculations. It is a GUI application that allows users to input operands and operators through a display window. The application provides a "Calculate" button that initiates the calculation process.

The calculator only allows users to enter numbers using the buttons provided on the GUI. The application displays an appropriate error message if the user attempts to divide by zero or enter an incorrectly formed postfix string for an equation.
